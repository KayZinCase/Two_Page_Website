# Two_Page_Website
The div tags for the logo and the sign in , content and footer are working perfectly until the html is linked to css file.
After that, those tags do not work anymore.
I tried to correct those but fails.
Those tags works if the link to the css file is deleted but then the website does not have any styling anymore.
I could not find the solution for this conflict.
